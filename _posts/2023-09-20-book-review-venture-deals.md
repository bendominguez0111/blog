title: Thoughts on Venture Deals
---

Lately I've been reading this book called Venture Deals: Be Smarter Than Your Lawyer and Venture Capitalist by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson.

I wanted to read this book because I felt like much of my knowledge about how the venture capital world works was pretty fractured, and this book came highly regarded. 

I mean, I knew that companies raised capital in a sucession of series', and before that they raised money from angel investors. Eventually, the company would grow big enough that it would go public through an initial public offering, which is the big liquidity event everyone is one day hoping for. I didn't know how that all unfolded, though. 

I also knew that there were different financial instruments through which companies could raise funding, like Convertible Debt, Preferred Equity, and SAFE agreements, but didn't know which facilities were appropriate for which situations and which lifecycle stage of the company. 

I also knew that companies would negotiate with VCs via a term sheet, and there were different levers that were pulled within that to strike a deal, but in hindsight, I didn't know any of the terms. 

I didn't understand how any of the above tied together. I hope one day to start a company and go through the venture capital process, and felt as though this was a critical missing piece in my education.

Before I summarize the book to help me ingrain the information, a brief review:

This book is dense, especially for those without a corporate finance or accounting background. I didn't feel like I had to look up any financial terms, but I also got a master's degree in Accounting and work in finance. The book is full of some useful annecdotes/wisdom, especially in the latter half, but the first half is straight information. I had to reread some chapters multiple times. It reads like a textbook, which is refreshing for a business book. I rarely pick up business books anymore, since most are full of fluff and a lot of times you feel like you're reading a 300 page advertisement for someone's online course. But this one was jam-packed with great info. Overall, 8/10.
